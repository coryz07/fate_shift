# Fate Shift - Precision Chart Analyzer

A forensic-style life pattern analyzer that combines deterministic astrology, numerology, and critical period analysis to map life paths with scientific precision.

## Features

- **Precision Birth Chart Analysis**: Advanced astrological calculations with deterministic algorithms
- **Numerological Life Path Mapping**: Mathematical analysis of birth date patterns and destiny numbers
- **Critical Period Identification**: Scientific detection of major life transition windows
- **Interactive Timeline Visualization**: Dynamic timeline showing life patterns and significant periods
- **Forensic-Style Interface**: Clean, analytical UI designed for precision and clarity

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript for robust frontend development
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Custom Astrology Engine** with deterministic calculation algorithms
- **Mathematical Numerology Library** for precise life path analysis
- **Interactive Timeline Components** for pattern visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
